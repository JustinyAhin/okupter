# Okupter

This repository hosts the code for [okupter.com](https://www.okupter.com).

## Stack
This is a static website that is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and generated with [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro). It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.

I use [Forestry](https://forestry.io) as a visual interface to edit the content on the site, although most of the time I will be writing posts in Markdown directly from my code editor.

## Local Development

The site requires Node 14.15.0 or higher.

The following commands will install the site packages, and launch it in your local environment:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
