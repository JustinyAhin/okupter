I definitely think that the more we immerse ourselves in a technology, the more a bubble forms around us and our ways of thinking. Over the past four years, my bubble has been built around [**WordPress**](https://profiles.wordpress.org/justinahinon/ "WordPress"), its community and its ecosystem.

I like to define myself as a person who is eager to learn, and very curious. Over the years, I've explored other technologies, from frontend frameworks to static site generation tools and headless CMSs to accessibility and web performance.

And I've always wanted to share my findings, the things I've stumbled on, etc. But I've also always been reluctant to do so on my [personal blog](https://segbedji.com). Partly because I've built this blog around WordPress and my expertise on the subject.

## Why Okupter?

> The word **Okupter**, comes from the ancient Greek **_ōkúpteros_**, that can be translated as /swift-winged/. The adjective is used to refer to something fast, sharp, or precise.

I discovered it by chance a few months ago, and of course I bought the domain name (without a fixed goal at first).

Then I started working on this blog to talk about subjects that are important to me, like accessibility, web performance and many other things.

I hope I can achieve this goal and share as much as possible here.

**I'm Justin Ahinon, and I welcome you on Okupter :).**
